# Meta Theory
### Man of God

1. Theories describe experience
2. An axiom is that which is taken for granted
3. There are foundational axioms
4. And directional axioms
5. Without foundation a theory is groundless
6. Without direction a theory is pointless
7. Natural axioms are true state of facts independent of the theory
8. Base point
	1. Base \<–\> Natural and foundational axioms
	2. Point \<–\> Directional axioms

## Example

### Base
**Natural Axiom**
* Natural resources
* Living beings

**Foundational axiom**
* Output is the rate of natural resource consumption by living beings

### Point
**Directional axiom**
* Minimize output
