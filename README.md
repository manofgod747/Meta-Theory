# Meta Theory
### Man of God

1. Theories describe experience
2. An axiom is what is given
4. There are foundational axioms
5. And directional axioms
6. Without foundation a theory is groundless
7. Without direction a theory is pointless
8. There are natural axioms. A true state of facts independent of the theory

## Example

**Natural Axiom**
* Natural resources
* Living beings

**Foundational axiom**
* Output is the rate of natural resource consumption by living beings

**Directional axiom**
* Minimize output
