# Meta Theory
### Man of God

1. Theories describe experience
2. An axiom is that which is taken for granted
3. There are foundational axioms
4. And directional axioms
5. Without foundation a theory is groundless
6. Without direction a theory is pointless
7. Natural axioms are true state of facts independent of the theory

## Example

### Economic Theory

***Natural Axiom***
* Natural resources
* Living beings

***Foundational axiom***
* Output is the rate of natural resource consumption by living beings

***Directional axiom***
* Minimize output

**Theorem**
Minimize living beings
