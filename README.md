# Meta Theory
### Man of God

1. Theories describe experience
2. Theories have axioms
3. An axiom is that which is taken for granted
4. There are foundational axioms
5. And directional axioms
6. Without foundation a theory is groundless
7. Without direction a theory is pointless
8. There are natural axioms. A state of facts is true by virtue of the theory
9. Base point
	1. Base \<–\> Natural and foundational axioms
	2. Point \<–\> Directional axioms

## Example

### Base
**Natural Axiom**
* Natural resources
* Living beings

**Foundational axiom**
* Output is the rate of natural resource consumption by living beings

### Point
**Directional axiom**
* Minimize output
