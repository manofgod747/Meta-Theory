# Meta Theory
### Man of God

1. Theory describes experience
2. Axiom is what is given
3. There are foundational axioms
4. And directional axioms
5. Without foundation a theory is groundless
6. Without direction a theory is pointless
7. Natural axioms are true state of facts independent of the theory

## Example

### Economic Theory

***Natural Axiom***
* Natural resources
* Living beings

***Foundational axiom***
* Output is the rate of natural resource consumption by living beings

***Directional axiom***
* Minimize output

**Theorem**
* Minimize living beings satisfies minimize output

***Foundational axiom***
* Preserve life

## Question

What needs to be the case to infer theorems?
